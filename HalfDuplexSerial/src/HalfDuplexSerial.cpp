 Decription:
 halfDuplexSerial is an abstract class used to communicate serial data in half duplex mode.
 This base class comes with to implemantation :
  - hardHalfDuplexSerial used Arduino built-in UART to communicate. A direction pin is used to switch between receive & transmit mode
  - softHalfDuplexSerial used change interrupts to communicate with only one pin.
